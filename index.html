          Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition
          of knowledge, skills, values, morals, beliefs, and habits. Educational
          methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and
          directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance
          of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education
          can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that
          has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be
          considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called
          pedagogy. Formal education is commonly divided formally into such
          stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school
          and then college, university, or apprenticeship..

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-sm">
          Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
          knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In
          pre-literate societies, this was achieved orally and through
          imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one
          generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge
          beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal
          education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the
          Middle Kingdom.[2] Matteo Ricci (left) and Xu Guangqi (right) in the
          Chinese edition of Euclid's Elements published in 1607 Plato founded
          the Academy in Athens, the first institution of higher learning in
          Europe.[3] The city of Alexandria in Egypt, established in 330 BCE,
          became the successor to Athens as the intellectual cradle of Ancient
          Greece. There, the great Library of Alexandria was built in the 3rd
          century BCE. European civilizations suffered a collapse of literacy
          and organization following the fall of Rome in CE .

          Education designed to support early development in preparation for
          participation in school and society. The programmes are designed for
          children below the age of 3. This is ISCED level 01.[16] Preschools
          provide education from ages approximately three to seven, depending on
          the country when children enter primary education. The children now
          readily interact with their peers and the educator.[16] These are also
          known as nursery schools and as kindergarten, except in the US, where
          the term kindergarten refers to the earliest levels of primary
          education.[18] Kindergarten "provides a child-centred, preschool
          curriculum for three- to seven-year-old children that aim[s] at
          unfolding the child's physical, intellectual, and moral nature with
          balanced emphasis on each of them."[19] This is ISCED level 02.[16]
